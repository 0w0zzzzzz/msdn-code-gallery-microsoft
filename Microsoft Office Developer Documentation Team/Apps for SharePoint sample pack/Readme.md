## Description

<p>Some of the SharePoint add-ins (formerly called &quot;apps for SharePoint&quot;) in this package are configured as &quot;autohosted&quot;. The autohosted preview has been discontinued. These sample add-ins still work when debugged with F5 in Visual Studio. To actually deploy
 a sample in SharePoint, you will need to make a small change in the appmanifest.xml file. Replace the &lt;AutoDeployedWebApplication&gt; element and all its child elements with this string: &quot;&lt;RemoteWebApplication ClientId=&quot;*&quot; /&gt;&quot;</p>
